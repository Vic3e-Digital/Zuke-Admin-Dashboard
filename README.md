## 🔄 Understanding "Sim Cards"

**Sim Cards** are the individual tool cards within each main category. Think of them as apps within an app store:

- **Main Sim Cards** (Large category cards) = The folders that organize related tools
- **Sim Cards** (Smaller tool cards) = Individual features you click to launch

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
Dashboard Sidebar
 ├─ Business Tab

 │       ├─ Sim Card: Get Leads & Customers
 │       └─ Sim Card: Business Chat (Neo AI)
```

**How It Works:**
1. Click a **Main Sim Card** (e.g., "Build a Plan for Your Business")
2. The page expands to show all related **Sim Cards** (tools) in that category
3. Click a **Sim Card** to launch the tool in a modal window or dedicated page

## 🔑 Recent Changes & Improvements

### Audio Transcription System (Latest Session - November 20, 2025)

#### 1. **Auth0 Authentication Fix**
- **Issue:** Auth0 not available in iframe context
- **Solution:** Exposed `window.auth0Client` globally in `app.js` after client initialization
- **Impact:** All pages can now reuse Auth0 client, enabling proper authentication in iframes
- **Files:** `public/js/app.js`

#### 2. **API Route Correction**
- **Issue:** Frontend fetching `/api/audio-transcribe` returning 404
- **Solution:** Updated frontend to call correct endpoint `/api/audio-transcribe/transcribe`
- **Impact:** Audio transcription endpoint now properly routed and accessible
- **Files:** `public/pages/creative/transcribe-audio.html`, `public/pages/creative/audio-transcribe.html`

#### 3. **Environment Variable Parameterization**
- **Issue:** Azure model deployments hardcoded in code
- **Solution:** Added environment variables for flexible deployment management:
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_WHISPER_DEPLOYMENT`
  - `AZURE_OPENAI_DIARIZATION_DEPLOYMENT`
- **Impact:** Easy model switching without code changes
- **Files:** `api/audio-transcribe-api.js`

#### 4. **Cloudinary Storage Integration** ⭐ Major Change
- **Issue:** Audio files stored locally on disk, limiting scalability
- **Solution:** Migrated to Cloudinary CDN with complete refactoring:
  - Changed `multer` from disk storage to memory storage
  - Created `uploadAudioToCloudinary()` function with Cloudinary API integration
  - Updated database to store Cloudinary URLs instead of local filenames
  - Environment variables: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
- **Impact:** 
  - ✅ Scalable, global CDN storage
  - ✅ No local disk usage or file cleanup needed
  - ✅ Automatic file lifecycle management
  - ✅ Public URLs for future retrieval
  - ✅ Cloud-ready architecture for Azure deployment
- **Files:** `api/audio-transcribe-api.js`

#### 5. **Buffer-Based Processing**
- **Issue:** Filesystem dependency limited cloud deployment options
- **Solution:** Modified transcription pipeline to use memory buffers:
  - File stays in memory as `req.file.buffer` (multer memory storage)
  - Passed directly to Cloudinary upload function
  - Forwarded to Azure Whisper transcription
  - No temporary files created or cleanup required
- **Impact:** 
  - ✅ Faster processing (no I/O wait)
  - ✅ Reduced system resource usage
  - ✅ Cloud-friendly architecture
- **Files:** `api/audio-transcribe-api.js`

#### 6. **Authentication Flow Improvements**
- **Solution:** Implemented multi-level fallback pattern for iframe compatibility:
  - Primary: URL parameters (most reliable)
  - Secondary: Parent window dataManager (iframe parent)
  - Tertiary: Own window dataManager
  - Fallback: Auth0 getUser() method
- **Impact:** Works in all contexts (standalone page, iframe, embedded)
- **Files:** `public/pages/creative/transcribe-audio.html`, `public/pages/creative/audio-transcribe.html`

### Database Schema Updates

**Audio Transcription Record** now includes:
```javascript

    size: Number                    // File size from Cloudinary
  },
  audioFileName: String,            // Original filename for reference
  audioSize: Number,                // Original file size

  created_at: Date                  // Timestamp
}
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Use `.env.example` for reference
2. **Auth0 Secrets** - Store API audience and client secrets securely
3. **Cloudinary Preset** - Use unsigned upload preset for browser uploads
4. **Azure Keys** - Rotate API keys regularly
5. **N8N Webhooks** - Use HTTPS endpoints only
6. **MongoDB** - Use connection string encryption and IP whitelisting
7. **File Uploads** - Validate file size and type before processing

## �� Troubleshooting

### Audio Transcription Returns 404

- Verify `auth_config.json` has correct credentials (domain, clientId)
- Check browser console for Auth0 SDK errors
- Verify Auth0 app configuration allows your domain

### Cloudinary Upload Fails
- Verify `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` in `.env`
- Check network tab for API errors (status 400, 401, etc.)
- Verify unsigned upload preset is configured in Cloudinary dashboard
- Ensure preset is set to "unsigned" for browser uploads

### Azure Whisper Errors
- Verify `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Check deployment names match exactly: `AZURE_OPENAI_WHISPER_DEPLOYMENT`
- Ensure audio format is supported (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG)
- Check API quota and rate limits in Azure portal

### Database Connection Errors
- Verify `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` (local or cloud)
- Check MongoDB is running (if local)
